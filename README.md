"Machine learning and Aritificial Intelligence: Concepts, Algorithms and Models"

Here are some sample chapters for the book I have been writing since 2017. I hope you enjoy reading it. Please let me know if you spot any mistakes in the book, or if you believe I should explain a part better than it is explained, please contact me at (rezar -at- bu.edu).

I might upload a few more chapters here as well, if you like to get them, keep watching this repo.

I should acknowlegde many people who helped me in this journey, especially my amazing comic illustrators: Shakiba Sadeghi, Fereshteh Alikhani, Beatrice Bassolli
