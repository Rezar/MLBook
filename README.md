# "Algorithms and Concepts of Machine learning"

These are sample chapters for the book I am writing since 2017. I hope you enjoy reading it. Please let me know if you spot any mistakes in the book, or if you believe I should explain a part better than it is explain let me know.

Since the tone of this book is very different than other books, I doubt if I can publish it with a common Computer Science publisher. Therefore, I do appreciate donnations, which I use it to pay my amazing comic designers, proof reader, editor. I promise that I do not use donnations to pay the weed seller in the street, or the steroid dealer in the gym.
